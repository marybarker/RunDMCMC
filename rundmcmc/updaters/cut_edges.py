    Use this decorator to create an updater that responds to flows of cut
    edges between parts of the partition.

    Decorate a function that takes:
    - The partition
    - The previous value of the updater for a fixed part P_i
    - The new cut edges that are just joining P_i at this step
    - The old cut edges that are just leaving P_i at this step
    and returns:
    - The new value of the updater for the fixed part P_i.

    This will create an updater whose values are dictionaries of the
    form `{part: <value of the given function on the part>}`.

    The initializer, by contrast, should take the entire partition and
    return the entire `{part: <value>}` dictionary.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        @on_edge_flow(initializer, alias='my_updater')
        def my_updater(partition, previous, new_edges, old_edges):
            # return new value of the part
